# Dot_Vex_File_Convert_Python3

I create this project so I can decode the .vex file's very professional ___ThIsisATemPoRaRyFiLE___.json into .H, .C, and other files and encode them into the .vex

## The working things:

- Extract and Decode
- Convert to .vex File
- All the browse
- load and save config automatically
- Replace

## The not working things:

- Help
- Convert between V C++ to C++ Pro

## HOW TO USE IT?

The `extract and decode` requires `.vex open`, `temp folder`, `code folder`(where the decoded files are going to save). **DO NOT USE THE SAME FOLDER!!**



The `Convert to .vex File` requires `.vex open`, `temp folder`, `code folder`, `.Vex save folder`,`.vex  save name` . **DO NOT USE THE SAME FOLDER!!**



A safe replace will be coming soon.
